**A.** There are many ways to fix this, my prefered way is by changing an INI setting in `Skyrim.ini`. 
If you're using `Mod Organiser`, modify the INI through the `INI Editor` in MO's tools, at the top of the window.  Inside `Skyrim.ini`, under `[General]`, add this line: `bDisableAllGore=1`. Voila!
Note: this will also disable alot of gore-type content including decapitation and dismemberment.
