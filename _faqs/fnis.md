**A.** There is more than one possible source of this problem. The most common is that you have not installed FNIS properly.

**To install FNIS properly, follow these steps:**
1. When installing FNIS, download it and start the installation as usual until you are greeted by a popup like the screenshot below. When you see that, open the `FNIS Behavior SE 7.6` folder and right-click `data` then select `Set as <data> directory`. You can then select `OK`

2. In the right panel of Mod Organiser, click the `Data` tab, then navigate to `tools > GenerateFNIS_for_Users` then right click the `GenerateFNISforUsers` application and select `Add as executables`.
