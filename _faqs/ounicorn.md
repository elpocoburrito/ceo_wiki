**A.** Unicorn has a lot of damaged scene data that needs repairing and it's transitions are incomplete. I'm working on cleaning up the xml and will release it as just the working scenes featured in the movie. It will not have transitions in it's first release but has a  number of high quality scenes and is about the size of Dual Wield.
