**A.** Assuming you are using Shlongs of Skyrim (or a body which uses SoS for dick-management like HIMBO), you need to make sure to keep every donger size/type settings at default. You technically can change these settings but any change you make may have weird repercussions on the end result with OSA/OSex/OStim.

In other words, if you want to be safe and have good "fitting" of male hammers with female's pies, dont adjust their size in MCM and dont change the addons in the Mod Manager installation of Shlongs of Skyrim.
