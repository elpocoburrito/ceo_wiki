**A.** This is often an issue with the skeleton (XPMSE). You should make sure you have XPMSE installed and that its skeleton isn't overridden by another mod. A frequent culprit is the Shlong of Skyrim (SoS) mod which bundles a skeleton which isnt as feature-complete and compatible as XPMSE. Make sure that XPMSE overwrites any mods which conflicts with it my drag-n-dropping it below SoS (or any conflicting mods). To see which mods have conflicts with others, click on a mod and all the mods that have conflicting files will be shown in green/red. green means the currently selected mod takes priority, red means the currently selected mod is getting overwritten.
