**Are you wondering what mod manager to use? Should you do it manually by drag-n-drop? That's what i will explain here!**

Should you install mods by hand? No. Never. At all.

**Now that this is said, should you use Vortex or Mod Organiser 2?**
Most people will agree that MO is less confusing, works better and has more features. Mod Organiser is also more popular, especially among people that do alot of Skyrim modding. This means you will get better support if you need to ask for help. Vortex can be used without too much trouble if you know what you are doing and/or prefer it but, if you are not too deep into Vortex, you should switch to Mod Organiser.
