## **WIP - Incomplete page**
## Here are listed mods (and tips) that i would recommend for a stable Skyrim SE with OStim/OSex content.
For the record, those are my (ElPocoBurrito) recommendations. You may agree, you may disagree. I am open to suggestions, comments and critiques.

The mods included here will mostly be general pupose stability/QoL mods or mods i believe are not susceptible to personal preference that much. I will also avoid OWorld mods since the description of OStim has almost all of them and is more up to date.

I will include a section with mods which are more opinionated at the end for what I personally use and enjoy.

First and biggest tip: Use a mod manager; to be more exact, use Mod Organiser 2. This will save you headaches.

## Recommended mods

**Unoficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch [+++]** <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266>
Kinda self explanatory, there is a reason this mod has over 210 000 endorsements. Get this for stability's sake.

**Static Mesh Improvement Mod - SMIM [+++]** <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/659>
A massive amount of meshes which will make your game look much better. Its one of those mods that the whole community installs without even having to think. Load before any other visuals improvement mod in MO.

**High Poly Project [++]** <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12029>
Similar to SMIM, but also touches textures. Great project.

**Bug Fixes SSE [+++]** <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33261>

**SSE Engine Fixes [+++]** <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17230>

Both those 2 mods target the same kind of niche: fixing bugs that have long plagued Skyrim, including many bugs that affect modded Skyrim even harder than vanilla. I recommend to use both, they have some overlap but were developped to not conflict with one another. Highly recommend those 2 mods.

**SSE Display Tweaks [+++]** <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34705>
This mod is *amazing* and fixes pretty much every issues related to skyrim graphical rendering. It fixes alt-tabbing, unlocks FPS for 144hz gameplau, unties Skyrim physics from framerate, which caused many issues including flying cart in intro sequence. It fixes double mouse and so much more. It is, in my eyes, a must have that alot of players dont know about yet. Being allowed to alt-tab out of the game is a god-send by itself.

**Vanilla Script (Micro)Optimisations [++]** <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54061>
This mod is great to increase FPS and also Skyrim stability by reducing the load on the papyrus engine. It is made by our very own SubHuman, which you can chat with on CEO's Discord.

**Exterior FPS Boost** <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54907>
Nice improvements to FPS, especially for weaker PCs. Be warned that it can have many incompatibilities with other mods that remove "architecture" from the outside world.


## Personal suggestions
If you're looking for a good looking ENB + Weather mod setup, this is what i found to be looking very good. It gives a look somewhat close to Tetrachromatic ENB on Skyrim LE, which was my favorite. 

Definitely very fantasy/vivid looking setup:

**PI-CHO ENB [Azurite preset]** <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35082>

**Azurite Weathers** <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42731>

**I don't use a lighting mod**
