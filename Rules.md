# Rules and guidelines
First and foremost, this server is created and administrated by people that use their free time to build this server and everything surrounding it out of enjoyment. We work hard but we also have actual work/school that takes priority. Here you will find the rules and also suggestions that should improve your experience and the experience of other players.

## Rules

### Chat and ingame conversations
- Talking about cheats and ways to abuse the system is prohibited, unless done through private messages with a staff member. Exceptions can be made for lighter offenses, to the moderator's discretion.
- Racism, slurs, insults, agressive/passive agressive messages, bullying or harrassment is not tolerated.

### Ingame behavior
- Griefing is not be tolerated. We have a claim system in place to help people protect their homes and constructions, but if for whatever reason, someone's building is unclaimed, you are not allowed to damage it or to take their belongings.
- When Jeannie (PotasticP) is streaming, do not give her gear and items unless she asks for it. Giving her endgame items breaks the fun both for her and the stream viewers since she doesn't have anything left to do after that.
- When Jeannie is streaming, don't harrass her with messages and don't follow her around.

### Third party software/hacks/cheats/mods
- No hacks or cheating allowed. This include but is not limited to the following:
  - XRay
  - Exploit tools
  - Dupe glitch
  - Hacked clients
  - Anything giving an inherent unfair advantage
- Mods like Optifine, ressource packs, shaders, minimaps etc. are allowed as long as they don't provide a significant advantage. 
  - Quick note: The server runs Minecraft 1.15.2. If you want to use Optifine, you can find the preview version on the official website hidden under a "preview" button since the stable 1.15.2 is not available yet.
